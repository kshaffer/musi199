Continue to work on your transcription project and rhythm performance, and spend time with your partner(s) working on getting any remaining first and second species counterpoint ready for assessment.

Read the resource on [third species counterpoint][third].

ENTRY TICKET: Using the model third-species exercises distributed in class (extras will be in the tray on my office door), locate at least one example of each dissonance type: *dissonant passing tone*, *dissonant neighbor tone*, *double neighbor*, and *nota cambiata*.

If you have assessed, or are ready to assess, second species, you can take a stab at some third species with your partner before class. Be sure to sing through several of the model exercises to get the sound in your head before you attempt composing.
