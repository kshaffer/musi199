Review the course syllabus, and email me with any questions you have about anything on it.

Review the topics and objectives for Unit I, and email me with any questions you have about it.

Read about consonant and dissonant intervals (at the bottom of the [intervals and dyads resource][intervals]), and about [types of contrapuntal motion][motion].

Purchase a headphone adapter, if you do not have one already. You need a 1/4" male stereo headphone jack to 1/8" female stereo headphone jack. (Something like [this][RS] or [this][CTG].)

Log in to [Learning Catalytics][LC] and take the quizzes on *consonance and dissonance* and *types of motion*.
