Read about consonant and dissonant intervals (at the bottom of the [intervals and dyads resource][intervals]), and about [types of contrapuntal motion][motion]. Tweet any questions you have about either reading, including the course hashtag in your tweet. If you see a question you can answer, please answer it.

ENTRY TICKET: Log in to [Learning Catalytics][LC] and take the quizzes on *consonance and dissonance* (session 945843) and *types of motion* (session 171477). 

(If you do not attempt both quizzes—or contact me ahead of time to discuss what will hinder you from doing so—you will be counted absent from class on Wednesday.)
