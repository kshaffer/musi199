Review, if necessary, the following resources: 

- [Intervals and dyads resource][intervals]
- [Types of contrapuntal motion][motion]
- [Composing a cantus firmus][CF]

If you have not yet successfully assessed cantus firmus writing and singing, work on composing cantus firmi that can pass in class on Thursday, or your ability to sing the cantus you have composed.

I will post quiz pass/fail results in your grade reports this afternoon or early evening. You can check your right/wrong answers now by logging into [Learning Catalytics][LC]. If you did not pass one or both quizzes, please re-take the quiz before Thursday's class. (consonance and dissonance: session ID 334656; types of motion: session ID 87393)

ENTRY TICKET: On your own or with a partner, sing (and possibly play) through the model first-species counterpoints distributed in class (extra copies are in the tray on my office door). As we did for cantus firmi, analyze them for common characteristics. Each student should tweet at least one *original* observation, or one *correction* to another classmate's observation. Be sure to add the course hashtag (#musi199) to receive credit.
