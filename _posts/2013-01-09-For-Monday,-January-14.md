Continue to work on composing and singing first-species counterpoint (unless you have already successfully assessed it), with a view towards assessing Monday or Tuesday.

Investigate the websites for the following music notation applications:

- [Finale][finale] – a paid application that is installed on lab computers  
- [NoteFlight][noteflight] – a web-browser-based application with both free and paid account options  
- [MuseScore][musescore] – a free, open-source application compatible with most platforms  
- [Lilypond][lilypond] – a free, open-source application compatible with most platforms (no graphical interface, but a powerful typesetting program)  

You will be asked to submit counterpoint assignments in at least two different applications in the near future, so that you can get a good idea which of these programs you are most comfortable with.

ENTRY TICKET 1: Based on what you read about the four programs, post two tweets with the course hashtag. These tweets should identify which two notation applications you plan to try, with a brief explanation why (one application/explanation per tweet). Be sure to read your classmates' tweets, in case they thought of something you didn't that may lead you to change your mind.

ENTRY TICKET 2: If MuseScore or Lilypond is your choice, download and install it on your computer, and bring that computer to class if your are able. If you chose Noteflight, set up a free user account before class. If you plan on using lab computers for these assignments, you can skip entry ticket 2.
