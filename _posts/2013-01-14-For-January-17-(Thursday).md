### New Material ###

We will spend a good portion of Thursday's class working on bass-line transcription. 

Bring to class whatever resources you plan to use for your transcription workâ€”including decent headphones and a device to playback the audio. I expect the transcription submitted in music notation software, so bring what you need for that, unless you are planning on using a lab computer.

For Friday, read the resource on composing a second-species counterpoint, and watch the included video. There will be a short, open-note quiz.

### Continuing material ###

If you have any voice-leading assessments up through first-species still open, work towards completing those successfully.

Continue practicing rhythm performance outside of class, in order to assess level zero, one, or two next Tuesday.
