### New material ###

Read the resource on composing a second-species counterpoint, and watch the included video. There will be a quiz (see below).

ENTRY TICKET: After reading and watching the above resource, take the short *second-species counterpoint* quiz on Learning Catalytics (you can use notes and course resources while taking the quiz). This will not be a graded quiz, but will tell me 1) if you read/watched the required material and 2) what concepts need to be addressed directly in class before we begin work composing second-species exercises. *An honest attempt is required in order to be counted present for the day.*

### Continuing material ###

If you have any voice-leading assessments up through first-species still open, work towards completing those successfully as soon as possible.

Continue practicing rhythm performance outside of class, in order to assess level zero, one, or two next Tuesday.
