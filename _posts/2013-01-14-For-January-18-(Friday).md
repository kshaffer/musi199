### New material ###

Read the resource on [composing a second-species counterpoint][secondSpecies], and watch the included video. There will be a quiz (see below).

ENTRY TICKET: After reading and watching the above resource, identify and label at least one example of each weak-beat technique on the model second-species handout distributed on Wednesday. You can work with a partner, but each individual must come with their own copy and be prepared to discuss their annotations and the reasoning behind them.

### Continuing material ###

If you have any voice-leading assessments up through first-species still open, work towards completing those successfully as soon as possible.

Continue practicing rhythm performance outside of class, in order to assess level zero, one, or two next Tuesday.
