Each student will have a 4-minute slot in which to perform rhythms from sight. You can choose to perform rhythms at level zero, one, or two. (See the Unit I Rubric above for details.) You will only get one shot, so pick an appropriate level based on your practice thus far. In the remainder of class time, prepare for this assessment, work individually on your transcription, or work with a partner on a second-species counterpoint exercise.
