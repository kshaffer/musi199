Begin working on your pop/rock transcription project, and continue working with your partner on first and/or second species counterpoint. 

We will spend part of class time working on rhythmic performance, and the other part we will work on species counterpoint.

There is no entry ticket on Thursday. However, there *will* be an entry ticket for Friday relating to the transcription project. See [the post for Friday][jan25] and for [the project][trans] for details, and consider beginning work on that now.

Keep in mind that the deadline for species counterpoint is Friday, February 1. All assessments must be completed by 4pm on that day. Be sure you and a partner are working hard toward that deadline.
