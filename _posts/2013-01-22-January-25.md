Class activity will likely focus on species counterpoint, but will depend on progress made on Wednesday and Thursday. 

Continue to work on your pop/rock transcription project and to work outside of class with your species counterpoint partner if possible. Keep in mind that the deadline for species counterpoint is Friday, February 1. All assessments must be completed by 4pm on that day. Be sure you and a partner are working hard toward that deadline.

ENTRY TICKET: Bring what you have transcribed from your song so far, so I can examine it. You need to have made an honest start on the project, or you will be counted absent for the day. I will let you know if you are on the right track, so you have a good idea what to do over the weekend.

See [the post for the project][trans] for details.
