In the 199Shared folder, there are (or soon will be) four songs for the first Unit I transcription project—pop/rock bass lines. Song assignments are below by initials (first–last; for privacy on the course website). Transcribe the entire bass guitar part, and submit your transcription in music notation software. You must use one of your top-two choice programs for this project, and the other program for the second transcription project (a choral bass part). Both must be completed by 12:00am on Monday, February 4.

You are *not* to consult with any other student working on the same song. However, you are encouraged to show your transcription to a classmate working on a different song to receive feedback on *what you have already transcribed*, as well as to provide such feedback to your classmates. Do not provide answers for each other, only general feedback. 

The following feedback is fine:

- Looks good to me.  
- Pitch looks good, but I think the rhythm needs a little work.  
- Straight rhythms are good, but the syncopations are giving your trouble.  
- I think the bass is too high in mm. 5–10.  
- Try this different EQ setting.  
- I think you've transcribed the guitar, not the bass guitar.
- etc.

The following feedback is *not* okay:

- You have a G in m. 25, but it should be an A.  
- Let me show you what I think this measure should look like.  
- Let me play you on the piano what I think it should be.    
- Your half notes should be dotted-quarter notes followed by eighth rests.  
- This is awful. You should drop the class.
- etc.

If you have any questions about appropriate feedback, ask me, or just don't give it. As always, I am available during my office hours, as is our tutor in the Learning Cent[er], to provide help.
