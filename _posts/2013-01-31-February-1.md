Continue to work on your transcription project and rhythm performance, and spend time with your partner(s) working on getting any remaining species counterpoint ready for assessment. Mind the deadlines on the Unit I rubric (and the updated voice-leading deadline).

On Friday, we will work on and/or assess species counterpoint.

On Monday, we will work on and/or assess species counterpoint and rhythm performance.

On Tuesday, each student will have a 4-minute rhythm performance assessment in my office, the final one of Unit I.

There is no entry ticket for Friday, Monday, or Tuesday.
