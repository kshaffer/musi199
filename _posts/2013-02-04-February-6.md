I have extended the deadline for strict voice-leading. Species counterpoint exercises can now be assessed until 4pm on Wednesday, February 6. Class time on Wednesday will be devoted to those assessments. Use your time wisely on Monday and Tuesday (especially in class, while others are assessing rhythm) to prepare for voice-leading assessments on Wednesday. Come ready to perform on Wednesday, not just ready to work on some third or fourth species.
