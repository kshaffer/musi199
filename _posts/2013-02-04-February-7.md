Bring the following to class on Thursday:

- staff paper
- your laptop (unless you use lab computers)
- your headphones and adapter

Also, review the Unit II rubric (see link above) before class, and bring any questions you have about it.

We will begin class with a dictation exercise, for me to find out where everyone is on their listening abilities after our work with transcriptions and performance in Unit I. The remainder of class will be devoted to installing and setting up software we will use for harmonic listening work in Unit II, and if time permits, we'll start using it so you can get the hang of it.
