Bring your Karpinski *Anthology* to class on Monday. We will spend most of our time singing.

Also, if you're still having issues getting BassGenerator to work, bring your laptop and I'll help you get it straight. (I figured out how to fix the issues the Macs were having.)

There is no entry ticket.
