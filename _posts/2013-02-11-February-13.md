Read the resources on [thoroughbass figures][TB] and keyboard-style [voice-leading][VL]. Look over the voice-leading exercise you did in class on Tuesday and improve it based on these readings. 

ENTRY TICKET: Bring the improved version to class on Wednesday. If you missed class, there are extras in the tray on my door. Complete it as best you can.
