Read the resources on [musical functions][func] and [harmonic functions][harm]. Come prepared to analyze chords for their harmonic function and provide an uninterpreted functional-bass label.

Bring the model keyboard-style voice-leading handout, as well as your keyboard-style exercise, to class, as we finish up our analysis of model keyboard-style voice-leading.
