Read the following resources on strict keyboard-style voice-leading:

- The new sections on *tendency tones* and *functional dissonances* in the resource on [Strict keyboard-style voice-leading][kb].  
- The resource on [Classical cadence types][cadence], paying special attention to *authentic cadences*, *simple cadences*, *compound cadences*, and voice-leading principles for simple and compound cadences.

Bring staff paper and a *pencil* to class, for more work with keyboard-style voice-leading taking the above principles into account.
