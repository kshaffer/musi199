Compose at least one basso continuo realization for one of [these bass lines][bass]. Be sure to analyze the function of each chord and treat any functional dissonances properly, in addition to following the basic principles of good voice leading. If you feel comfortable with it, compose two (one in major and one in minor). Practice playing through it as you compose it, and when you are finished.

In class, you will share your realization with a classmate. If *and only if* both of you believe it to be free from voice-leading errors, you can perform it for me for an assessment in class. Otherwise, you and your partner will try to help each other improve your solutions.

If you plan on working with someone in particular, it may be wise to choose different bass lines from each other, so that you can more freely offer feedback without worrying about inadvertently relying on one another's work in an inappropriate way.
