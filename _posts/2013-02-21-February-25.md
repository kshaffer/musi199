If you are comfortable moving forward with voice-leading, continue work on basso continuo realizations with the goal of assessing this week (some bass lines are [here][bass]). Be sure to analyze the function of each chord and treat any functional dissonances properly, in addition to following the basic principles of good voice leading. 

Also, if anything needs to be revised or re-assessed for inclusion in the midterm grade, please do so by Monday. After that, I will only be looking at Musicianship IV projects.

Lastly, read Chapters 29â€“30 in the Karpinski *Manual*. ()Chapter 29 is for your own information. We will not discuss it, but you will be expected to know those terms and symbols when they appear in music we study and/or perform.)

Bring the Karpinski *Anthology* to class on Monday.
