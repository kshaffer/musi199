Review Tuesday's class activity on [Learning Catalytics][LC]. Read the explanations for each answer, and write down any questions you have about either the correct analyses or the explanations. Also, review the resource on [Harmonic syntax][syntax].

Using the [bass lines][bass] distributed last week, revise your basso continuo realization(s) from last week, and/or produce a new one. Come to class with *at least* one realization that you believe is ready for assessingâ€”preferably two. Be sure to come having practiced it at the keyboard, comfortable playing it for me or for a classmate. Also, perform an *interpreted* functional bass analysis of your realization(s). Though the voice-leading and harmonic analysis will be assessed separately, you are required to analyze the harmony for anything you plan on assessing.
