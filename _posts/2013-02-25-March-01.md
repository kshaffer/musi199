We will begin class with a quiz on harmonic syntax. This quiz will entirely be composed of harmonic analysis of figured and unfigured bass lines. You will be asked to provide both an *interpreted* functional bass analysis and a Roman numeral analysis.

The quiz will take place on [Learning Catalytics][LC]. Be sure to bring an appropriate device. (There will be a time limit, but it will not be rapid-fire like last semester.)

Review the resources on [harmonic syntax][syntax], [harmonic functions][func], and [cadences][cad] as necessary. Also, you may find it helpful to read the resource on analyzing [Roman numerals from a thoroughbass][RN]. The resource on [triads and seventh chords][triads] from last semester also contains information on Roman numerals.

The remainder of the class will be dedicated to singing and/or listening. Please bring the Karpinski *Anthology*, staff paper, and a pencil.
