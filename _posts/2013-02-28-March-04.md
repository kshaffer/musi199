Review the correct answers to Friday's quiz in [Learning Catalytics][LC]. Come to class with any questions about them. Scores will be in your DropBox grade report.

If you have not successfully assessed major and minor *basso continuo* realizations, compose and practice those (or whichever one is remaining) with a view toward assessing on Monday. Remember to perform at least an uninterpreted functional bass analysis of the bass line *before* doing the voice-leading, and perform an *interpreted* functional bass before assessing it.

If you have already successfully assessed *basso continuo* realizations, read/watch the resource on melodic keyboard-style voice leading: [melodic keyboard-style schemata][schemata], [demo video][vid]. Bring an attempted melodic keyboard-style realization of any of the figured bass lines we have used in class so far.
