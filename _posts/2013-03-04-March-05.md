Bring Karpinski anthologies to class tomorrow. We will begin the class with some sight-singing practice in advance of Thursday's assessments.

Also, if you have not successfully assessed major and minor *basso continuo* realizations, compose and practice those (or whichever one is remaining) with a view toward assessing on Monday. Remember to perform at least an uninterpreted functional bass analysis of the bass line *before* doing the voice-leading, and perform an *interpreted* functional bass before assessing it.

If you have already successfully assessed *basso continuo* realizations, read/watch the resource on melodic keyboard-style voice leading: [melodic keyboard-style schemata][schemata], [demo video][vid]. Bring a completed melodic keyboard-style realization of any of the [figured bass lines][bass] we have used in class so far (I will be adding more to the original four bass lines on Monday).

*Everyone should come to class with **either** the remainder of their basso continuo realizations, one melodic keyboard-style attempt, or both.*
