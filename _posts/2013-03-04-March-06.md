Please come to class with at least one new melodic keyboard-style realization of a [figured bass line][bass]. You may need to review the resources on melodic keyboard-style voice leading: [melodic keyboard-style schemata][schemata], [demo video][vid].

Wednesday's class will be the last main chance in class to assess keyboard voice-leading. We will have very limited time on Friday, so try to get everything done by Wednesday.

Everyone should have completed their basso continuo realizations. If you have not assessed both of those, *you are behind* and need to catch up immediately.
