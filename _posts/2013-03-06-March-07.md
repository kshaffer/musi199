Prepare for Thursday's sight-singing exam. Look over melodies in the *Anthology* from the chapters on the subdominant triad, dominant triad, and dominant-seventh chord, in particular.

Also, prepare at least one (preferably two) melodic keyboard-style voice-leading realizations. Use a good chunk of class time practicing them, and proofreading each other's work. You can assess them during class on Friday (we'll have about 20 minutes or so) or during my Thursday afternoon office hours. Friday's class will be *the last time* to assess them for Unit II.
