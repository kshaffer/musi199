We will begin class with a quiz on harmonic syntax. This quiz will entirely be composed of harmonic analysis of figured and unfigured bass lines. You will be asked to provide both an *interpreted* functional bass analysis and a Roman numeral analysis.

The quiz will take place on [Learning Catalytics][LC], following the same format as last week's quiz. Be sure to bring an appropriate device. 

To prepare, review your answers (and the correct answers) from last week's quiz in Learning Catalytics, as well as any comments I provided in your grade report. Also helpful are the resources on [harmonic syntax][syntax], [harmonic functions][func], [cadences][cad], [Roman numerals from a thoroughbass][RN], and [triads and seventh chords][triads].

The remainder of the class will be dedicated to assessing melodic keyboard-style voice-leading exercises. This is the last opportunity to assess those during Unit II.
