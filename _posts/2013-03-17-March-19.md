Perform at least three exercises in BassGenerator. Give yourself no more than four hearings each (the first hearing can be two back-to-back in order to get oriented to the key), and write down as much as you can of the bass line, functional bass, melody, and figures (in that order of priority). Bring both what you transcribed *and* the answer given by BassGenerator to all three to class. You will show them to your classmates and discuss strategies for listening more accurately.

Bring staff paper and a pencil to class. We will work on both harmonic and melodic listening strategies.
