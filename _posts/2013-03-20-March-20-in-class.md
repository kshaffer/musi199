Create a timeline of "Pleasant Valley Sunday," by the Monkees in [Variations Audio Timeliner][VAT]. (The audio file is in the [199Shared folder][shared] on DropBox.) In your timeline, divide the song into whatever units make sense to you. Label each unit with terms you already know (intro, outro, etc.), or with "A," "B," "C," etc. Make sure that any passages that sound similar get the same or a similar label.
