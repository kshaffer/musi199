Be sure to email me the timeline for "Pleasant Valley Sunday" you created in class.

Read the resource on [Form in pop/rock music][form], focusing especially on sections II–IV. Because it is essentially a glossary, and a lot of the definitions refer to other terms, you will likely need to read it at least twice to make sense of it. Come to class with a basic understanding of the terms in parts II–IV, and *written* answers to the following questions:

- What is the difference between a *phrase* and a *module*?  
- How can you identify the beginning and the ending of a phrase by ear?  
- How can you tell the difference between a *strophe* and a *bridge* by ear? (In other words, when listening to a song, what do you listen for in order to determine if a module is a strophe or a bridge?)  
- Is "Pleasant Valley Sunday" in strophic, AABA, or verse-chorus form?
