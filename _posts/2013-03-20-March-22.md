Friday will begin with a dictation assessment. We'll do both melodies and harmonic progressions. Then we will discuss melodic listening strategies.

Dictate the following melodies from the CD accompanying the Karpinski text:

- Chapter 11, no. 1  
- Chapter 11, no. 11  
- Chapter 19, no. 2  
- Chapter 19, no. 4

Try to get them as correct as possible (preferably without the keyboard). Write down how many listenings it took you, and whether or not you used the piano to get it correct, and bring to class for discussion and review. If you have time/need, do some practice exercises in BassGenerator to prepare for the harmonic dictations.

Bring staff paper to class (obviously).
