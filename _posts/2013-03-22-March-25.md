For Monday, please spend some time with BassGenerator in *minor* (use **minor.py** instead of **major.py**). That seems to need to most practice right now, based on Friday's dictation work. Please do at least four exercises in Minor before class on Monday, more if you have time. Checking yourself at a keyboard as you go would be helpful for many of you.

In Monday's class, we'll work on listening skills in minor keys, and probably spend a little time on rhythm as well. Be sure to bring staff paper and a *pencil*.
