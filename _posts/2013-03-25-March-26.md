In preparation for more work on melodic listening, dictate the following melodies from the Karpinski text/CD, and note how many listenings it took to get it correct.

- Chapter 19, no. 3  
- Chapter 19, no. 5  
- Chapter 19, no. 6  

In Monday's class, we'll discuss these melodies, work on listening skills in minor keys, and probably spend a little time on rhythm as well. Be sure to bring *lots* of staff paper and a *pencil*.
