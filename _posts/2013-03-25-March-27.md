We will return to pop/rock form on Wednesday and Thursday. Be sure to bring a Learning-Catalytics-capable device to class both days.

In preparation for our work, review the [pop/rock form resource][form], and come to class with *written* answers to the following.

*For the following pairs of functions, summarize the difference between the two. Do not simply define each. Imagine hearing a passage of music: what feature(s) of the music would you pay close attention to in order to determine which of the two functions are in operation for that passage.*

- strophe v. verse  
- bridge v. chorus  
- prechorus v. climb  
- chorus v. refrain  
- mid-song introduction v. Janus module  
- bridge v. prechorus
