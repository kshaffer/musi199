Review [Learning Catalytics][LC] activities from this past week on song forms, and review the [pop/rock form glossary][form] for core module functions. We will work with module functions on Monday. Bring an appropriate device for Learning Catalytics to class.

You also may want to take the long weekend to spend some time with BassGenerator or the Karpinski CD, working on your dictation skills. We will do some more in-class practice with that this week, and do another dictation assessment on Friday the 5th.
