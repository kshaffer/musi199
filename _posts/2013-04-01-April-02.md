In general this week, spend your out-of-class time preparing for Friday's listening assessment. Use the Karpinski CD and BassGenerator for that practice.

Also, for tomorrow, please complete/clean up your module analysis of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" by Nirvana. You should note the timing and the function of every module (don't worry about phrases or cycles yet).

Lastly, if you have a laptop, please bring it to class with [Variations Audio Timeliner][vat] installed.
