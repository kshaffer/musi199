Spend some time working on BassGenerator, particularly in minor. We will work on harmonic dictation on Thursday, so this will help you prepare for that.

Bring your laptop with Variations Audio Timeliner, and your analysis of "The Moment I Said It" from class today. We will complete and discuss that analysis in class on Wednesday.
