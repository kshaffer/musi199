Dictate the following melodies from the Karpinski book and CD. Write down the number of listenings, and whether or not you used the keyboard.

- Chapter 22, no. 8  
- Chapter 22, no. 10  
- Chapter 25, no. 1  
- Chapter 25, no. 4

8am section: Since I will be helping out Jonathan Sircy in his English class, I will not arrive until 8:40 or 8:45. Use that time to go over your notations of these melodies in groups of 3â€“4 people. You may revisit the recordings as you discuss. If your group finishes before I return, please begin practicing the harmonic dictation schemas I left in my office door at the keyboard. We'll go over the melodies together and dig into the keyboard task when I return.

Bring your headphone adapters for that practice, since you will be practicing them individually.
