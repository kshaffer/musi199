All sections:

We will spend time on harmonic and/or melodic listening. 

8am section:

There is no assignment. Spend some time practicing whatever needs the most work in advance of Monday's listening quiz (melodies, BassGenerator, or practicing keyboard progressions). Bring your headphone adapters for practice keyboard harmony progressions, since you will be practicing them individually.

10am section ENTRY TICKET:

Dictate the following melodies from the Karpinski book and CD. Write down the number of listenings, and whether or not you used the keyboard.

- Chapter 22, no. 8  
- Chapter 22, no. 10  
- Chapter 25, no. 1  
- Chapter 25, no. 4
