On Monday, we will have our second listening quiz, including both melodies and keyboard-voice-leading progressions. 

In preparation for the listening quiz, spend time singing, playing, or transcribing whatever is giving you the most trouble. Use the Karpinski book and CD, BassGenerator, and the keyboard voice-leading schema handout from Friday's class. (Extra copies are in the tray on my office door.)

I highly recommend that you "prime" the patterns in your long-term memory by coming to class (or a practice room) early and playing through these patterns at the keyboard. It will make it easier to recognize those patterns in the context of the quiz.
