Read the resource on [harmonic schemas in pop/rock music][harmony]. Be sure to listen to the chord progressions in the various embedded music videos. (Though you won't need to listen to the entirety of each song to hear the progression. Most are at the beginning of the song, or the beginning of the first chorus.) We will go through examples of these schemas in class. Recognizing them will help both your general ability to hear harmonic progressions, and your ability to analyze phrase and module structures by ear.
