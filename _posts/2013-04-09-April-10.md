Review Tuesday's Learning Catalytics activity on pop/rock harmonic schemata. Based on that activity, review the resource on [harmonic schemas in pop/rock music][harmony] as necessary. 

Keep in mind that you *cannot* cram for the dictation exam. If you are having any difficulty with that, spend some time playing through the keyboard schemata, dictating progressions from BassGenerator, and/or transcribing melodies from the Karpinski text & CD.
