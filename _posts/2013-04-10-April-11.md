Review Tuesday's Learning Catalytics activity on pop/rock harmonic schemata. Based on that activity, review the resource on [harmonic schemas in pop/rock music][harmony] as necessary. 

(Re)-read the [triads and seventh chords resource][triads]—sections on lead-sheet symbols and Roman numerals—as well as the [resource on Roman numerals from a figured bass][RN]. Also bring staff paper *and* the keyboard-style voice-leading schemata packet.

We will spend some time working through harmonic analysis issues, and then look at some harmonic dictation.
