We will begin by singing a couple worship song arrangements together in parts, then we will move to analysis, per the following guidelines.

For the worship arrangements distributed in class, do the following with a partner:

- Circle all non-chord tones, and label them by type according to the ["Embellishing tones" resource][et].  
- Draw a box around every functional dissonance.  

Tweet your responses to the following questions, unless someone else has already tweeted the same answer, or respond critically to something already tweeted:

- How do non-chord tones in the alto and tenor parts behave?  
- How do the functional dissonances behave?  
- Find the pitches that are the suspended or added 2nd or 4th for sus2, sus4, and add9 chords. How do those pitches behave?  
- What principles of species counterpoint and/or keyboard-style voice leading are routinely broken in this style?  
- Are there new principles you can determine to be at work in this style that are not operative for species counterpoint or keyboard-style voice-leading?

Be sure to think like a composer/arranger. What principles do you need to keep in mind in order to compose your own arrangement that matches this style?
