There is no prep assignment for Tuesday or Wednesday. We will be analyzing pop/rock-style voice-leading in class on Tuesday, and looking at texts of secular music in Wednesday. 

Come ready to work both days, and bring your Bibles on Wednesday.

Also, once posts are up on the course website, look ahead to the assignments due on Thursday, Friday, and Monday. They are longer than usual. Take the opportunity to start working ahead on them and/or preparing for the dictation final.
