Read the resource on [Voice-leading in contemporary Christian worship music][popVL]. Be sure to budget time for the video (around 30 minutes long). This one is HD, so if you anticipate problems with the wireless network, view the original Vimeo page and download it in advance of watching it. You will not be able to fully participate in Thursday's activity (which will get you started on your final project) without engaging these resources.

Bring a laptop on Thursday if you have one. We will begin your worship song arranging projects in notation software.
