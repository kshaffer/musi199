Download the audio for "Mexico," by Jump, Little Children, in [199Shared][199]. In Variations Audio Timeliner, make a timeline including phrases, modules, and cycles. Label phrases appropriately with lower-case letters (a, b, c, etc., or srdc), modules with capital letters (V1, V2, C, A1, A2, B, etc.), and cycles with curly brackets {VPC}.

This timeline will be the basis for our class activity and discussion on Friday, which will likely be our last discussion of pop/rock form before the final exam.

Please note how long it takes you *undistracted* to put this timeline together. (This will help me plan the final exam appropriately.)
