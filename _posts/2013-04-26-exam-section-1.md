Create a timeline in Variations Audio Timeliner of the following three songs:

- 867-5309/Jenny (Tommy Tutone)  
- A Hard Day's Night (The Beatles)  
- Blue Suede Shoes (Carl Perkins)

Audio for these songs can be found in the [199Shared][share] folder, in a subfolder called **199-1 final.**

Timelines should include the following details:

- phrases  
- modules  
- cycles  
- whole-song form

Create your timelines in order, beginning with 867-5309, and do your best to complete at least the first two songs by 10:30.

When finished, save your timelines (the v2t file, not the mp3 file) to your DropBox assessment folder, or email them to me. I prefer DropBox.

If you have not done so yet, be sure that both the score and the video for your worship song arrangements are in DropBox. And be sure to fill out [my class survey][survey] (or make a video) and the CSU course evaluation.
