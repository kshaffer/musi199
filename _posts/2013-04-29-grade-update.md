Grade reports are now up to date except for pop/rock form finals, pop/rock voice-leading projects, and a few stray reassessments that are in my email. Please consult these reports to plan any reassessments remaining Tuesday or Wednesday.

Note that the pop/rock voice-leading assignment *must* match the format of the example in the video to receive full credit in the technology category. That means one staff (treble) as melody, alto, lead sheet symbols, and lyrics, while the other staff (treble-8) has tenor. There should be no bass line on the final score.

Also keep in mind that for the tech category, you must have shown me scores in two different applications for species counterpoint and/or keyboard-style voice-leading. I decided I don't need to see each task in two different programs, but I need to see each task in something, and I need to see that you've done something in two different programs. Current tech grades reflect everything but the pop/rock-style project. If you do that correctly, you can assume an additional point on your current tech score.
