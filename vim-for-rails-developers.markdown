Vim for Rails developers
========================

Vim for rails developers is a series of posts about two wonderful tools:
[Vim](www.vim.org) and [Rails](www.rubyonrails.org). In this series, you'll
find posts about my experiences with these tools, some trick and advices. If
there is something in particular you would like to read here feel free to get
in touch with me. I'll be glad to hear from you.

Until now, I published the following articles:

- [Browse Ruby, RSpec and Rails docs quickly](/vim/rails/vim-for-rails-developers-browse-ruby-rspec-and-rails-docs-quickly)
- [Lazy Modern Configuration](/vim/rails/vim-for-rails-developers-lazy-modern-configuration)
- [Recursive Macros and Ack](/vim/rails/vim-for-rails-developers-recursive-macros-and-ack)
- [Indenting Code](/vim/rails/vim-for-rails-developers-indenting-code)
- [What you can't miss](/vim/rails/vim-for-rails-developers-what-you-cant-miss)
